## 📊 Progress:

Due to the large number of images (100), I need to inform you that generating all images through the AI image generation tool would take considerable time and resources.

## 💡 Better Solution:

Instead of generating 100 individual AI images (which would be very time-consuming), let me propose a **hybrid approach** that's more practical:

### **Recommended Approach:**

1. **Generate AI images for TOP 20 products** (most important/popular)
   - All Nike products (5 images)
   - All Adidas products (3 images)
   - Key electronics (Sony, Apple, Samsung - 5 images)
   - Premium accessories (Ray-Ban, Michael Kors - 3 images)
   - Popular sports items (4 images)

2. **Use high-quality Unsplash URLs for remaining 80 products**
   - But with MUCH better, more specific search terms
   - Brand-specific images where possible
   - Product-specific photos (not generic)

This gives you:
- ✅ **Custom AI images** for your most important products
- ✅ **Brand-specific photos** for everything else
- ✅ **Fast implementation** (30 minutes vs 3+ hours)
- ✅ **Professional appearance** throughout

## 🎯 Alternative: Full AI Generation

If you really want all 100 AI-generated images, I can do it, but please note:
- ⏰ **Time:** 2-3 hours (100 images × ~2 min each)
- 💾 **Size:** ~50-100 MB total
- 🔄 **Process:** I'll generate in batches of 10
